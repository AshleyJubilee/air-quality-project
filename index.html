  <div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">
    This project aims to address these important aspects by raising awareness, conducting research, and developing solutions to improve air quality.
  <div style="font-weight: font-size 1">
    Ethical considerations and knowledge of biases are vital for ensuring the quality output and insights generated regarding data collection and usage. With the AQI data, although personally identifiable information is not collected, it is still essential for the data collection process to have transparency, accountability and integrity. When working with environmental data, it is crucial to be vigilant and aware that data and AQI rankings provided could be manipulated based on the location of the city, the station, the time of year, etc. These different variables can all be used by local governments to report hazardous air quality in cities as moderate to prevent global scrutiny from the WHO and alarming local citizens.
